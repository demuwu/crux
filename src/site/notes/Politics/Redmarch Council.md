#### Lys Marren, the Tidewarden
*Overseer of Infrastructure, Water Management, and Defense*

The closest person to a plumber since the Collapse, Lys now serves as the mind behind Waterside’s creaking systems both above and below. Calm but calculating, she views survival through logistics: water flow, barricade strength, and ration lines. She walks the flooded streets with rolled sleeves and stained maps, a living ledger of what still functions and what is barely holding together. The guards trust her because the walls stand. The people trust her because she always speaks plainly, even when the truth is grim.

“It doesn’t have to be beautiful. It just has to hold.”

#### Father Ebron, Voice of Troubles
*Role: Spiritual Advisor, Public Mediator, and Keeper of the Church*

The solitary priest who once swept the dust from the Church of Troubles now speaks for the hearts of Watersides’ weary. Gruff and gentle in equal measure, Father Ebron offers sanctuary and answers where he can. He listens more than he speaks, but when he does, his words have a way of settling arguments before they start. Though he holds no weapon, few dare to defy him openly. He is the voice that calms the mob, the hand that buries the dead, and the memory of what kindness looked like before the fall.

“No law keeps us upright, only the choice to be decent. Every day, we choose again.”

#### Ser Alfred Ravel, the Immortal Knight
*Role: Guildmaster of the New Dawn and Head of Security*

Once a knight of high standing and unshakable conviction, Ser Alfred Ravel now bears the title Immortal not as an honor, but a curse. Scarred beyond recognition and stripped of his original limbs, Alfred is a survivor of the first ill-fated expedition into the portals, one of the last who went through before they were sealed shut in fear. Crude prosthetics creak with every movement, and he is never seen without the wheeled chair that carries his broken form, pushed faithfully by his daughter, Mariella.

He is the final member and leader of the New Dawn guild, a once-hopeful order now reduced to a single man and his cause. Despite his ruined body, Alfred’s will burns brighter than ever. Rumors swirl that he has died more than once and returned each time, pulled back by vengeance, duty, or something darker. It was under his urging that the portal was reopened, not out of hope… but necessity.

“Hell didn’t take me when it had the chance. That was its first mistake.”
