The Highborn are a loose coalition of ancient families and influential individuals, each able to trace their lineage back through generations of power, prestige, or divine right. Though they stand at the pinnacle of wealth and influence within Crux, their unity is fragile at best, fractured by rivalries, pride, and centuries of political entanglements. Rarely do they act in concert, and only threats that endanger their collective status or survival can compel them to set aside personal ambition for a shared cause.

Below are the most powerful of the groups.

# Velbond

Velbond is a gothic, oathbound house of those close to death; such as dhampirs, necromancers, and legacy-bound nobles who treat promises as sacred law. Every member carries an ornate dagger called a Bond, used in rituals where all parties cut their palms and shake hands to seal agreements. To break an oath is to invite punishment, fasting, flagellation, exile or worse.

For eternal pacts, both participants place hands together—the weaker or lower ranked member has their hand placed beneath and the Bond is driven through both palms to sanctify the vow. Grave dirt from Velbonds personal graveyard is packed into the wound and healed over with magic. These dark scars are worn proudly, proof of loyalty and suffering. In the eyes of Velbond, blood binds stronger than magic, and your word once given is absolute.
# Crownless Court

The Crownless Court is a secretive cabal of noble-born exiles, disinherited heirs, and second-borns who have cast aside their birthrights but not their hunger for influence. One does not apply to join; one is invited. Operating from the shadows of Waterside’s ruin, the Court weaves power through proxies; merchant fronts, puppet leaders, and whispered favors, guiding trade, alliances, and rivalries with practiced subtlety. Though they wear no crowns, their quiet reach shapes the district more than most would ever know.

On the rare occasions they act directly, members arrive masked, always in the guise of a grinning harlequin, a symbol of their mockery of power and nobility alike. The Court remains silent on current leadership, though their silence should never be mistaken for consent. Within their ranks, collecting symbols of leadership, seals, rings, and badges are both a mark of dominance and a gesture of defiance. They prize anonymity, cunning, and quiet orchestration, seeing themselves as kingmakers in a throne-less world where power is not inherited, but taken.

# House Zevir

House Zevir is one of the most powerful and feared factions among the Highborn, known for treating power as a means to an end. Obsessed with what came before, they maintain vast archives tracking the bloodlines and history of every influential family in Waterside they can get their hands on. Marriages are arranged by the most optimal choices, alliances forged through projected outcomes, and every decision is weighed for long-term yield. To them, nobility isn’t tradition, it’s the result of dedication.

Their members are trained from youth in logic, negotiation, and ruthlessness. Cold, efficient, and nearly impossible to outmaneuver as a group, Zevir prefers to influence from behind signatures and clauses. They do not gamble lightly, they calculate, and they always collect.
# Gravecoin Famiglia

In the worn-out veins of Waterside, where old laws crumble and new powers rise from the gutter, the Gravecoin Famiglia keeps the wheels of life turning for a price. They are the quiet hand in every trade, the unseen ledger behind every bargain, the ones who make sure everyone pays their share… whether they know it or not.

The Famiglia claims no thrones, no banners, and no palaces. Their kingdom is built in favors, dues, and quiet nods passed across tavern tables. Markets flourish because Gravecoin watches over them. Coin flows because Gravecoin ensures no one hoards what ought to be shared. Safety, prosperity, even a quiet corner to call your own are all things Gravecoin can provide or revoke.

To live under their gaze is to owe them something. To serve them is to thrive. To cross them is to vanish without a ripple.
