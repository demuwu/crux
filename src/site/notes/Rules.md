This community is for people 18+ but it is not a mature content community. It is the policy of our DMs that all hyper-violent, sexual, and especially things of a sexually violent nature be toned down to be better digestible to everyone. The Violence stops at around a Lord of the Rings level, any sexual moments Fade quickly to black after a kiss and swelling love-theme, and the Sexually violent are only inferred at the most distant edges. Please keep this in mind when interacting with people and RPing.

  

We aren’t here to have to deal with your rudeness, your personality issues, or social problems. We’re not asking for much, just politeness and the ability to follow the very understandable rules we’ve set down. If you can’t come here and leave real life baggage at the door when it comes to your interactions, then you will be asked to leave. We’re here to have a good time in the company of friendly people who want to lend themselves to that. The only drama here should be based in Roleplay and at the end of the day have no harm.
