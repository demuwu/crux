3. Hate against another community member will not be tolerated. (Race, Religion, Sexuality, Identity, Etc.)
4. Trolling has no place here. Trolling is immature.
5. Posting things political in nature is not allowed. 
6. Usernames must be in good taste. This includes profile pictures and any forward facing part of your community profile.
7. Keep direct suggestions and comments to the feedback box. Please be respectful of all parties.
8. Respect the Admins, DM, and other moderators of the community.  

This community is for people 18+ but it is not a mature content community. It is the policy of our DMs that all hyper-violent, sexual, and especially things of a sexually violent nature be toned down to be better digestible to everyone. The Violence stops at around a Lord of the Rings level, any sexual moments Fade quickly to black after a kiss and swelling love-theme, and the Sexually violent are only inferred at the most distant edges. Please keep this in mind when interacting with people and RPing.

  

We aren’t here to have to deal with your rudeness, your personality issues, or social problems. We’re not asking for much, just politeness and the ability to follow the very understandable rules we’ve set down. If you can’t come here and leave real life baggage at the door when it comes to your interactions, then you will be asked to leave. We’re here to have a good time in the company of friendly people who want to lend themselves to that. The only drama here should be based in Roleplay and at the end of the day have no harm.

# Player Behavior and Discipline

If you’re having issues with another player or even DM we encourage people to take the time to privately message and talk it out first before involving moderators.

If the problem doesn’t get resolved or escalates then a moderator can be messaged for mediation.   

Actions that require judgment will be interpreted based on the evidence at moderator disposal. When someone commits misconduct, relative disciplinary action will be taken against them. If, after deliberation, discipline is found warranted it is brought before moderators (who oversee misconduct/discipline) who confirms the decision and the severity of the punishment. Offenses committed are tracked. 

We implement a three-strike system. If a user receives three strikes, they will be kicked from the server.
