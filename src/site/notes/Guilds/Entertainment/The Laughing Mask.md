## Leader
#### Mister Hush

A silent sovereign of The Laughing Mask, cloaked in layered silks of black and gold, and hidden behind a pale, expressionless porcelain mask. He never speaks, never gestures more than he must. And yet, the entire troupe answers to him without hesitation. His presence alone is enough to quiet chaos and summon order, his footsteps soft as breath and always accompanied by the subtle chime of bells no one can quite place.

Rumors say he forfeited his voice and identity for a particular pact with something unknown, becoming not a man but a living role. Each year, during the troupe's most secret and final performance of the cycle, Mister Hush speaks a single line, and that line becomes a prophecy, a curse, or a blessing. Under Mister Hush, The Laughing Mask flourishes as both performance troupe and secret society, their shows threading entertainment with danger, and illusion with quiet truth. No one knows his true name, and perhaps no one should. After all, some masks wear the man.

### History


Equal parts circus, vaudeville act, and masked mystery cult. Draped in patchwork tents of impossible colours and adorned with enchanted lights that shimmer without flame, the troupe arrives without warning and vanishes just as swiftly leaving behind whispers and wonder. Acrobats, illusionists, jesters, and fortune tellers make up their ranks, each donning elaborate masks they never remove in public. No two performances are alike: one night might bring laughter and fire-dancing, the next might spiral into unsettling puppet plays that hint at forgotten tragedies. 

Though beloved in some circles, others see the Laughing Mask as dangerously unpredictable. Rumors abound of coded messages hidden in their routines, strange disappearances following their shows, and audiences who swear they've glimpsed something terrible smiling just behind the curtain. Whether they're prophets in motley or simply masters of misdirection, no one can deny their power to captivate and disturb.
