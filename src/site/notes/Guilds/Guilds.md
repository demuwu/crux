In [[Waterside/Waterside\|Waterside]], guilds are the lifeblood of survival and structure—fractured communities bound together by trade, ideology, or necessity. With the district cut off and resources scarce, guilds serve as everything from defense forces and crafting collectives to black market brokers and political factions. Whether built from shared skills or sheer despe
ration, each guild carves out its own corner of influence, offering protection, purpose, and identity in a city where law is fading and unity is earned.

## Academics

The Academics guild category encompasses those devoted to the pursuit of knowledge, understanding, and the advancement of thought. Whether they study ancient ruins, unlock arcane secrets, or chart the stars, members of this guild value insight over brute strength and believe that knowledge is the truest form of power.

## Bounty Hunter

The Bounty Hunting guild category encompasses those who make their living tracking, capturing, or eliminating specific targets—be they beasts, criminals, or other marked individuals. Driven by contracts, coin, or reputation, bounty hunters excel in precision work and dangerous pursuits. They operate on the edge of civilization, often walking a fine line between hero and mercenary.

## Commerce

The Commerce guild category encompasses those who deal in trade, wealth, and economic power. From bustling market stalls to sprawling caravans and shadowy auction houses, members of this guild understand the flow of coin better than any battlefield tactic or arcane spell. They thrive on negotiation, logistics, and the ever-shifting balance of supply and demand.

## Creation

The Creation guild category is home to those who shape the world with their hands, tools, and imagination. Whether working in wood, metal, stone, or magic, these artisans bring form to function and beauty to utility. Members of this guild believe that craftsmanship is a sacred calling—one that leaves a lasting mark on the world. From enchanted armor to intricately carved statues, they are the makers, builders, and dreamers whose work stands long after battles are forgotten.

## Entertainment

The Entertainment guild category encompasses those who dedicate themselves to art, performance, and the power of expression. Whether they aim to inspire, provoke, comfort, or distract, entertainers are the heart and soul of culture—shaping how societies dream, laugh, and remember.
