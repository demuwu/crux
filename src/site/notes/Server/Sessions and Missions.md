## How to Reserve a Spot for a DND Game, Who Gets Priority

### Quest Board
A DM or a prospective player will post a quest in the Quest-Board at least 24 hours before the planned session date with the following details:

Quest Title
(@ the proper player roles)

**Recommended levels**: This level range will typically be two (2) below and two (2) above a target level. Please only bring PCs within said level range. 
**Players needed**: There is a minimum requirement of three (3) player sign ups, and a maximum of six (6). 
**DM**: @ the DM that is DMing this session, this will typically be who is posting the quest. Leave this blank if there is no confirmed DM yet.

**Quest Details**: This will be a blurb most likely containing a who, what, when, where, and why. Or written in the voice of the quest giver.
**Restrictions**: Limits on what type of PCs that can sign up. EG, without magic, those lacking a way to conceal their race, or characters not suited to the mission’s social demands (e.g., low Charisma) may be less appropriate. If not applicable, mark as N/A.
**Reward offered**: (From gold amount to magic items offered or a service, etc. Some quests do not have typical rewards, and must be found in game such as exploration or dungeon delving as examples.)

**Time/Date**: Timestamp posted using https://hammertime.cyou/

#### Sign Ups

A thread will be posted underneath the quest post for players to sign up for the quest. If the player has a character that can participate in it and if the player can make it to time/date they can sign up. The sign up format ranges from posting your Player Name, Player Character name, Player Character Class and Level, and if you have participated in any games within the last week (Seven (7) days) to figure priority. Priority determination will be further explained below. 

Sign Ups are first come first serve after priority is determined. 

### Priority

In the interest of fairness for making sessions calls, we want to encourage players to discuss the possibility of priority for sessions on their own, before otherwise determining rosters (like rolling). For instance, if the goal of a session is to complete a multiclass, the player whose PC is multiclassing could discuss with the others signed up if that should give the PC priority. Other examples include establishing encampments, or perhaps getting revenge for a grudge.

Priority for PCs should be with good reason and have group agreement. Above all, we want to encourage clear communication and discussion for session-making.

However, if there is no story or character-driven reason for priority, we give preference to players who have not participated in a session within the seven (7) days leading up to the scheduled quest. For example, if the quest is planned for Thursday, April 17th, players who have played on or after Thursday, April 10th will have lower priority than those who haven’t played during that time frame.

We trust players shall do their best to be fair in such priority to story based missions, and abusing such to play more often than others in an excessive amount is frowned upon, and if severe enough shall denote a strike.

### Back-Ups

If a Quest has more than over the maximum number of players signed up, players that have not been picked for the Quest are considered ‘Back-ups’.

### Session Call

On the day of a Quest, the DM hosting the session will post the Quest (while linking back to the quest post from the Quest-Board), the Hammertime stamp showing the correct time of the Quest, and ping the Players that have been chosen to participate. 

Players signed up are requested to show up on time for the session, if not then the DM will determine back-ups. Back-ups are explained further below.

#### No Call No Shows, Back-ups

If a player is late to a session and has given no forewarning or indication of when they'll arrive, after ten minutes from the start time, the DM will ping back-ups to draw in. Once a DM has put out this ping, the original player is officially replaced by the back-up.

#### Multiple Session Missions // RP Lock

Not all missions that are posted and you sign up for are just going to be one session. The DM may anticipate this, noting it in the Quest Board posting, or sometimes the session has to come to an end due to peoples’ bedtimes, IRL schedule, and such. 

If your PC is in a quest that is spanning multiple sessions/weeks you will be in something called RP Lock. RP Lock is a condition where you are limited in your contact with the world outside of your mission and current party. While in a quest that is RP Locked you:

- Can not spend Downtime Points, but they accrue with each weekly reset as normal.
	- You can still gain your PBP Downtime Points but you are still only limited to roleplaying PBP with your current party or NPCs that are around in the quest you are on.
- Can not add in or take out things in your character’s inventory from outside of the mission.
- May send messages to the outside world via spells like sending and animal messenger, or through courier if the DM allows it. Messages can not be sent or received if you are engaged in combat between sessions.
- May level up between sessions of a quest if you take a long rest at the end of the session in which you would level up.

### Post-Game

After a game is complete, the DM will determine the following:
- Milestones gained.
- Rewards received. 

To make sure that magic item distribution at the end of sessions goes fairly, we'd like to propose some guidelines, namely:
- The players that are interested in an item should determine whether they actually need the item, or if they simply like having magic items.
- All interested players should make their case on why they should be the one to receive the item.
- The number and quality of magic items the characters already have should be taken into consideration. (This doesn't include an item the 'winner' would hand out to the 'loser' as the new item replaces it.)
- If players can't agree once the DM asks for a decision, the item will be rolled for as usual, with the DM having veto powers should somebody argue in bad faith.

### EXP, Leveling Up, Milestones

In order to smooth the leveling process for players, experience is not earned based on creature kills like in traditional D&D. Instead it's rewarded for completing missions. We call this term milestones (MS). 

The typical guidelines for milestones gained is the following:
- Normal sessions gain 1 milestone
- Deadly and highly dangerous sessions grant 2 milestones on DM discretion
- Pure RP with no goal or stakes grants no milestones

A character levels up when they've earned their current level in MS, starting from level 1. For example, a level 2 character must earn 2 MS to level up to 3, and then earn 3 MS to level up to 4, and so on. Below is a list showing a character’s total MS to level ratio.

| Level | Milestones Required |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| **1**     | 0 MS                |
| **2**     | 1 MS                |
| **3**     | 2 MS                |

| **5**     | 10 MS               |
| **6**     | 15 MS               |
| **7**     | 21 MS               |
| **8**     | 28 MS               |
