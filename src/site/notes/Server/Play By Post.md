A portion of this server’s interaction and content can take place via Play by Post (PBP) threads. 

PBP threads can be started in the PBP CHANNEL NAME HERE by creating a thread and Pinging the Players or DMs (if interacting with a NPC) that you want to interact with. Describe where the scene is taking place, and who your character is approaching/what they are doing to start this PBP Thread.

We won’t police people on how to format their posts, just make it consistent to the people you are interacting with, for example: put dialogue your PC is saying in quotation marks. Descriptors, appearances and actions in normal text. Make it obvious which character is talking seeing as players may have more than one PC. 

We added the Tupperbox if you want to enhance your PBP experience by setting up your PC with an icon and posting as them instead. You can follow the guide for Tupperbox [here](https://tupperbox.app/guide/basics). This is completely optional to use.

You can read about discord text formatting [Here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline).

- All roleplaying is in character. If you want to type something in a roleplaying channel that is out of character, use double parentheses (( )) around it. However, excessive out of character (OoC) typing should be relegated elsewhere, such as the OOC CHANNEL HERE.

 - It is recommended to use discord's tagging function [@] to tag players or characters who are relevant to your roleplaying. This is to ensure that they see your post and do not lose the flow, especially when there are multiple players roleplaying in the same channel.

- Erotic roleplaying (ERP) and crimes of an exceedingly violent or sexual nature are forbidden from being performed. If you're not sure if something you're doing qualifies here, do not post it.

- You control only your character in roleplay. You cannot dictate the actions of another player's character, ever.

- For courtesy's sake, if you have not been pinged for the thread do not post in it. Either ask for permission to join, or if the scene opens up to your character being approached (therefore you being pinged to join) you may.

- If your character is leaving a thread please indicate this by typing **[PC NAME] exits**.

- If the thread comes to a natural stop or all players don’t feel like continuing said thread please indicate the end of the thread by typing **=END SCENE=**.

- Rolls between players can be dictated by players and don’t need DM assistance when it comes to determining outcomes. 

- IE: if a PC is making an Insight check to find something about your PC feel free to set your own personal DC in your head. Alternatively, roll a Deception check. 

- You can control familiars, animal companions, and pets your character possesses.

- You can reflavor abilities or appearances, or give unique flairs to something for your character, but these are merely for dramatization - it does not mechanically benefit your character, ever.

## DM Intervention

In some cases DMs may intervene certain PBP threads or conversations, or give input if they are pinged/asked a question. To keep things neat and readable they will format them the following way:

Single Bars (------) will be used to indicate a full stop to roleplay to give the DM a moment to type out their intervention. This may also be accompanied by an ability to be rolled.
