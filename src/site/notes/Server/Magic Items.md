### Magic Items // Auctions // Trader

Witches are allowed to use any items that specify: "Requires attunement by a Sorcerer, Warlock or Wizard".

PC’s can’t use magic items of a tier higher than your level, outside of consumables. The list below indicates what rarity items you can use at what level:
- **1-4** Common and Uncommon
- **5-9** Rare
- **10-14** Very Rare
- **15-17** Legendary
- **18-20** Artifact

*The only exception for this is if the DM gives you an (temporary) item that has to be used to complete a quest. Typically these are given in the beginning of the quest and returned at the end of the quest.*
#### Homebrew

Some magic items might not work properly in a DM's world, usually there will be a note on the Quest Board post if the DM is not allowing homebrew magic items from the other DM/portal worlds. If so, the player can substitute the item for one of equal rarity for that session from the DMG. 

#### Craft Magic Items

Crafting non-consumable magic items is a difficult and lengthy process. To even begin crafting a magic item, you require a recipe to be able to craft it. A recipe allows you to craft as many of the listed items as one wants, unless the recipe is lost or damaged.

Recipes can be given as a reward for a quest, or found in a session. Most recipes count as one rarity higher than the magic item they are used to craft.

Recipes typically require proficiency in certain tools, a GP amount, components ranging from gems, plants, creature parts, etc. Some recipes and their components may be specifically found in either Atlas or other portal worlds. 

### Market

If a player wishes to sell a magic item, they may choose to auction it instead. A minimum price is set by the seller, and players can place bids using gold, magic items, or valuable spell components. Bids are judged not only by value but by how closely they align with the typical market price for an item of that rarity. Auctions conclude 24 hours after the last valid bid.

If the item is priced unusually low or is of significant interest, NPCs may enter the auction or offer alternative proposals—such as quests, trades, or exclusive deals.

For fairness, players may not trade or gift items between their own characters under any circumstances, including through proxies—unless the item is publicly put up for auction. This includes through Guild vaults. 

Player characters can give other player characters items or money, but it must be logged accordingly in the # ENTER CHANNEL NAME HERE. If a player character is giving another player character money, it is up for those players to decide and note in the trade message if it’s meant to be a loan/debt to be repaid or not. If player characters aren’t responsible for paying their debts on time in-character punishments may occur.

Auction
- **Item:** Enter Item Name Here
- **Starting Bid:** What the Bid starts out with (ie, 100 GP for a uncommon item)
- **Minimum Increase:** The minimum amount of GP a player has to auction to raise (if it's set to 5 GP, then a starting bid of 100 GP has to, by minimum, increase to 105... 110... 115 GP if a player doesn't wish to go higher)
- **Optional -** Autobuy: The seller can set a price for which someone can buy the item outright

### Trader

For all unwanted and unsalvageable items, one trader will take these items and give you a quarter of its minimum price. This does not include cursed magic items.

#### Cursed Magic Items

For cursed magic items, they can’t be bought, traded, or auctioned normally^ unless a DM says otherwise. To be able to do so, you need to be part of an Underbelly Guild of a certain rank, to participate in buying or selling cursed items.

^*You can give cursed items to other player characters freely if desired… but that’s on you buddy.*

#### Mundane Equipment

You can purchase equipment from the table below.

However, any item that is 100 GP and more is not available, and has to be found in session or in other worlds that may have it in stock.
