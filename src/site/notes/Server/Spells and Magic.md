### Spells, Spellbooks, Spell Components

#### Banned Spells
The following spells are unavailable to Player Characters and DM’s, unless under very specific circumstances approved by all DM’s:

Wish
True Resurrection
True Polymorph
Gate
Forcecage

If any of these banned spells are a spell that is one that you would get from your class or subclass, choose another spell from that class's spell list of the same level instead.

#### Summon Spells

If you are a spellcaster who summons creatures, you are expected to inform a DM about what creatures you are most likely to summon in that session. You can only summon one creature that you haven’t informed the DM about, past that, any attempts to summon a creature fail.

Some minions, companions, or spells that scale require more nuance for sheets. Have these sheets in your folder, with their name, and your PC’s name in brackets eg (Joe Slopinski).
#### Wizard Spells

To learn new spells outside of leveling up, Wizards must have a spell scroll of the spell to attempt to copy it into their spell book.

#### Spell Components

Spell Components cannot be normally bought, unless already listed as Adventuring gear. They must be acquired during sessions or as part of an award. 

If a spell lists a component with a GP cost, you must have it for that spell and also note whether it is consumed or not.
