# Starting Equipment

You will start with the default equipment listed for your starting class.

# Retiring a Character

Once you’ve played a PC for a minimum of three (3) months or that PC has reached level five (5) you can retire them meaning you cannot play this PC in quests anymore. You can still roleplay the character if circumstances come up within reason. You do not keep any items or GP this PC may have gained.

For Seasonal Characters: Once a Season is over, you can retire that seasonal character from that season at any time.

# Backstory

There is no doubt that backstory is one of the most fun aspects of creating a character. You are encouraged to create a backstory to pair with your character, but keep in mind very important points:

- It is not canon in the world by default.
- There is no expectation that it will be touched upon by DMs in and out of sessions.
- The only facet of your background that has any actual weight is your background feature.

You are still free to use the backstory as a way to build and explain your character’s motivations, personality, and how they got to where they exist now within the world as an adventurer. You may reference your backstory in-character for narrative reasons, however you cannot gain any mechanical benefits nor influence the world’s culture with it—directly or indirectly. This is to say that nothing your character has done, who they are related to, or any other aspect of their lives can have an impact on the game.

Backstories written can be linked/written within your character sheet.

# Feats

Class Initiate, and Class Intermediate can only be taken using downtime points.

# Seasonal Characters

You have an extra character slot that can only be used for seasonal characters. Once every three months, there will be a unique character start available called a seasonal character.

They will be built around a theme, story, or idea with unique challenges or benefits attached to them. You can use up one of your character slots to alternatively play a seasonal character.

# Guild Rankings

When you create your Player Character you have the option of joining a guild (or not at all). A PC can only join a maximum of one (1) guild. 

Each guild has a Guild Rank from 1 to 5, and each individual PC has their own Loyalty Rank from 1 to 5. Loyalty is a system that can reward Guild members for staying in a Guild while supporting it, and can reward the Guild itself with specific benefits.

You can only gain the benefits of your Loyalty Rank, so long as your Guild Rank is equal or lower. All guilds start at rank 1. 

Guild buildings can hold a number of magic items of 10 per guild rank. Outposts can hold 5 per guild rank.

Once you are at Guild Rank 5, you can attempt to build an outpost in an outer world for your guild. These outposts start at Guild Rank 1, and must be upgraded and improved as normal.

# Guilds

When an adventurer joins the overworld, they can join and associate with a guild. This must be designated somewhere on the PCs character sheet. The list below are the guilds available to join, they are categorized into broad categories where adventurer’s can find fitting jobs that fits within the chosen guild (category). 

500 GP join fee for any NPC guild. Player made guilds, or unique guilds might have different requirements, or fees required to join the guild.

### Ranks

EACH GUILDS RESPECTIVE RANK FEATURES CAN BE FOUND UNDER [[Guilds/Guilds\|Guilds]].

There are two types of Guild ranks. One, the guilds overall rank and two, your PCs personal loyalty rank. Once you join a guild, you start at Rank I loyalty and can raise it up to Rank V by completing quests and favors for your guild gaining favor. 

How this works is if a Quest is posted in the Quest Board channel, the Quest Poster may note that Quest is sponsored by (x) number of guilds and list them. If a minimum of one (1) PC joins the quest under a Guild that is listed they will gain a point in both their Guild’s overall rank, and also their personal Loyalty Rank.

A PC can only benefit from the Guild Rank features as long as the Guild itself has reached that Rank and if you have reached that same rank with their personal Loyalty Rank.

Guilds also have their own Bank Vault, and require a minimum amount of GP saved to also be required to reach the next rank. These Ranks are listed below for both overall Guild Rank and Personal Loyalty Rank. 

- Rank I: 20 points 
- Rank II: 40 points
- Rank III: 60 points
- Rank IV: 80 points
- Rank V: 100 points

To raise a Guild’s overall Rank it is required to spend a GP amount to invest the required funds to expand the Guild’s influence, materials, etc.

- Rank I: 250 GP
- Rank II: 1,500 GP
- Rank III: 3,000 GP
- Rank IV: 10,000 GP
- Rank V: 15,000 GP

Guilds will have a Bank Vault posted in [CHANNEL NAME HERE] under a thread of the respective guild. Players can respond to the thread if they’re ever donating money into the bank and a DM will update it accordingly. Once the Guild is eligible to upgrade its overall Rank the money will be expended and taken out of the bank.
