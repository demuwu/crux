Downtime is a system through which players can use to make gold, purchase goods, craft, learn new skills, etc… To read more on downtime and what you can do with downtime refer to the following document:

**[5.5ke Downtime Document](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/mYhoGkfBocET)**

Every Sunday, at 11 PM CST is when the week “resets”. The player character has that time and onward of that given week to gain Downtime Points via server activities:

+5 Downtime Points (DT) is the base amount you accrue weekly. 
+5 DT if your PC participates in a Play by Post (PBP) thread that week. 
+10 DT if your PC participates in a session that week.

We require members to log weekly downtime in the Downtime Catalog channel, making a thread for each Player Character, showing the activities that PC has done that week. Please post this by weekly reset.
