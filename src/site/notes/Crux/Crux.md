The floating city of Crux has been heavily isolated from its various districts, or segmented areas that were meant for the functions and necessary components that make life on Crux possible. The city has more or less dissolved into isolated pockets of society that are separated from each other and independent.

This is no less the result of the heavy damage that Crux sustained all those centuries ago. Travel between districts is thought impossible, and has been the unsuccessful dream of many citizens.Â 

The city is divided into four large sections, with only the name of them being known to most due to the passage of time.
