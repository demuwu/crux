#### Earthside

The Earthside District, located in the western side of Crux was known to be the center for botanical research, farming, and animal husbandry which provided the city’s fresh food, herbal medicines, and organic resources. The district flourished with towering greenhouses, expansive gardens and tiered terraces alive with flora and fauna. Earthside is home to scholars and farmers who worked side by side to cultivate rare plants and pioneer experimental hybrid species.

While more than just a hub of life and study, Earthside offered refuge for the weary with its tranquil parks, walkways, and mineral-rich springs making it a beloved retreat for citizens that sought rest, recreation, or peaceful contemplation.
#### Fireside

The Fireside District, located in the northern side of Crux stood as the blazing heart of the city’s industry, innovation, and defense. Within its furnace-lit streets, forges roar day and night, casting a molten glow as smiths, engineers, and artificers labor tirelessly to craft the tools, weapons, and engines that were safeguarding Crux.

Fireside is a realm of fire and metal, where mastery over heat, pressure, and arcane technology fuels the city’s infrastructure and strengthens its fortifications. Towering chimneys pierced the skyline that veiled the district in a constant haze of smoke and steam, while the rhythmic clang of hammers echoed through steel-bound corridors. Raw material transformed into marvels of function and force: power cores, defensive constructs, and enchanted armaments that showed just how relentless, intense and proud Fireside was.
#### Waterside

The Waterside District, located in the eastern side of Crux was the lifeblood of the city’s hydrological systems. Crisscrossed with canals, irrigation channels, and ancient sewerworks this district managed every drop of water that sustained Crux whether it was drinking, farming, or defense. 

In the heart of Waterside was where the Deep Basin lay, a man-made lake fed by subterranean aqueducts where aquatic farmers tended to floating reed beds and fishmongers harvested shimmering, scaled creatures bred in controlled waters. This intricate system kept the city hydrated, crops nourished, and defenses pressurized as it was ready to flood, cleanse, or repel anything if needed. 
#### Windside

The Windside District, located in the southern side of Crux was a marvel of elevation and innovation. This was the city’s hub for travel, communication, and airborne power. Constantly swept by high-altitude winds and arcing lightning currents, Windside hums with energy both literal and symbolic.  

Windside was home to skysail docks and levitation towers that launched airships across skies, carrying messages, cargo, and passengers between Crux. Massive turbines and stormcatchers harvest electrical energy from the sky, powering everything from city lights to arcane systems deep within the city’s core. Windside was also home to Crux’s sky navy, a fleet of enchanted vessels crewed by elite navigators and stormborn tacticians that were ready to defend the city from threats anywhere.
