## Eldritch Moons

## Titans

Among the Calamities of Atlas are the Titans. Vast, beings that roam the shattered world below. They move across the wastelands with agonizing slowness or lie sleeping for centuries, mistaken for mountains, valleys until they stir. Sightings are rare, but for those in Crux who have peered through cracks or breaches in the city's floor, glimpsing a Titan is a horror beyond words, a reminder of how small even Crux truly is.

The greatest of them is called **Judgement**, a being so massive that, should it stretch out its hand, it could nearly cradle the floating city itself. Thankfully, Judgement remains below—for now—its slow, relentless movements warping landmass in its wake.

## Thorned Cradle

The rise of the Thorned Cradle is one thought to be the work of an ancient grove in the attempt to combat other calamities. This birth gave rise to a nameless Witch of breathtaking beauty, whose madness still stains the world. Where she walks, monstrous, twisted pets are made for her whimsical entertainment. Crops rot or bloom violently; rivers poison themselves or grant temporary, burning visions. No event around her is natural. Every blessing is a trap, and every curse a cruel joke.

## The Bitter Star

Long ago, the sky of Atlas split open and something monstrous fell: the Bitter Star, a living, sentient meteor that despises all mortal life. Burning with unnatural rage, it hurtles across the heavens or crashes into the earth without warning, carving craters where cities once stood and scattering clouds of toxic ash that choke survivors for miles. When grounded, the Bitter Star stirs and reshapes itself into jagged towers of molten stone and black crystal, warping the land around it into a festering, hate-filled wasteland.

The Bitter Star seems to move with purpose, targeting places where life struggles to endure. Scholars believe it can hear prayers, dreams, or hopes, and hunts them out of spite.
