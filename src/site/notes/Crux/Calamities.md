## Eldritch Moons

The floating rock in the sky that pulls and push the tides is no longer just that, it breathes, it cracks open to reveal a row of teeth, or even blinks only to stare back at those who look up to stargaze. Every cycle it changes, and evolves. One cycle it may rise with a sanguine glow of a blood moon. On another cycle the shadows thicken and the night air shudders as the moon emblazoned with a disquieting smile, projects its baleful grin upon Atlas; from its contorted face, a deluge of tar plummets, seeping from the moon's very countenance.

Sometimes the moon freezes over, conjuring forth the very essence of winter, blanketing the world with an unyielding blizzard that saps warmth from bones and clarity from thoughts. The moon can even herald a time of transformation and stirs the deepest emotions and lurking bestial nature within people, as it rises, a chorus of pain mingles with the snarls of newly transformed beasts.

Each drives people mad and transform the creatures in Atlas in unique, different ways. Sometimes the effects are only temporary, but some strike people to the very core and change them forever.
## Titans

Among the Calamities of Atlas are the Titans. Vast, beings that roam the shattered world below. They move across the wastelands with agonizing slowness or lie sleeping for centuries, mistaken for mountains, valleys until they stir. Sightings are rare, but for those in Crux who have peered through cracks or breaches in the city's floor, glimpsing a Titan is a horror beyond words, a reminder of how small even Crux truly is.

The greatest of them is called **Judgement**, a being so massive that, should it stretch out its hand, it could nearly cradle the floating city itself. Thankfully, Judgement remains below, for now, its slow, relentless movements warping landmass in its wake.

## Thorned Cradle

The rise of the Thorned Cradle is one thought to be the work of an ancient grove in the attempt to combat other calamities. This birth gave rise to a nameless Witch of breathtaking beauty, whose madness still stains the world. Where she walks, monstrous, twisted pets are made for her whimsical entertainment. Crops rot or bloom violently; rivers poison themselves or grant temporary, burning visions. No event around her is natural. Every blessing is a trap, and every curse a cruel joke.

## The Bitter Star

Long ago, the sky of Atlas split open and something monstrous fell: the Bitter Star, a living, sentient meteor that despises all mortal life. Burning with unnatural rage, it hurtles across the heavens or crashes into the earth without warning, carving craters where cities once stood and scattering clouds of toxic ash that choke survivors for miles. When grounded, the Bitter Star stirs and reshapes itself into jagged towers of molten stone and black crystal, warping the land around it into a festering, hate-filled wasteland.

The Bitter Star seems to move with purpose, targeting places where life struggles to endure. Scholars believe it can hear prayers, dreams, or hopes, and hunts them out of spite.

## Stillwake

Stillwake is a massive serpent made of constantly shifting sand, moving across Atlas like a living avalanche of sand Wherever it passes, time breaks down, people freeze in place, objects decay and rebuild, and days or years can pass in moments. Its body shimmers with fragments of past and future, never fully solid, always moving.

Stillwake doesn't attack or roar; it simply moves, and the world changes around it. Its breath warps everything it touches, aging the young, undoing years of work, and trapping victims in endless loops. 

Those who see it from Crux speak of sand falling upward and hearing echoes of things that haven't happened yet.

## Frozone

Frozone is a creeping, freezing calamity that turns entire regions into glittering wastelands. Any creature that dies within its reach rises again as a frozen statue, animated by mindless violence, yet the soul remains trapped inside, fully aware but powerless.

The frozen air warps reality, and some survivors have been said to see visions or monstrous beings in reflections. Frozone’s arrival brings a feeling of being watched by hundreds of unseen eyes.

## Nightmare

Nightmare is a parasite that infects a single host, trapping them in a fevered state where their worst fears become real. Shadows, monsters, and twisted illusions spill into the world, each one deadly and tangible. The longer the host survives, the worse the manifestations grow. Killing the host stops the spread, but their death often triggers a final, violent eruption of nightmares.

## The Weeping Womb

The Weeping Womb is a rotting, living mass of chimeric beasts fused together hidden deep within the ruins of Atlas, endlessly birthing monsters that carry disease and decay wherever they roam. Its spawn are twisted, half-formed creatures, dripping with sickness, their very breath enough to rot crops, fester wounds, and spread plagues through the entire countryside. Wherever the Weeping Womb's children pass, communities fall into ruin by fever, blight, and slow, agonizing death.

## The Drip

Beneath the broken skin of Atlas festers The Drip, an ancient calamity born from rot and ruin, feeding without end on death itself. It is no beast, no mind as mortals understand, but a crawling, sporing hunger. A vast, singular hive of thought that thrives wherever life falters and the dead are left to bloat and blacken. Every spore, every tendril, every rotting husk is part of a greater, dreaming whole, thinking in slow, patient pulses far deeper than human reckoning. Invisible spores seep through the soil, the air, the water, rooting themselves in corpses first, and then the living. Victims wither slowly, flesh softening, memories thinning to mist, until only pliant, fungal husks remain. 

Where The Drip takes hold, the world rots: walls sag, metal weeps, rivers clot with pale, writhing growths. It does not rage or roar; it simply consumes, turning the dead into gardens of decay and the living into seeds for further ruin. Scholars do not call it a plague, they call it a hunger Atlas will never be free of, a patient, devouring breath that waits for the day when there is nothing left but damp silence, endless bloom, and the cold, murmuring unity of the hive.

## The Verdant Archive

Deep within the broken wilds of Atlas lies a place where knowledge and living flesh have entwined beyond separation. Once a grand library built by hands long vanished, it has since awakened, its stones and shelves fed by the strange energies and calamities that shattered the world. The Archive is a colossal structure of ivy-choked spires, breathing walls of bark and bone, and vast halls where the books themselves hum faintly with life. Fungal blooms sprout from cracked marble, illuminated by the eerie pulse of roots threading through the air like veins.

A living entity, a mind that remembers every word ever written inside its walls and many more it has dreamed up on its own. Tomes whisper as you pass, turn their pages to tempt you closer, bite, or even drink. To walk the Archive is to be studied in return; to read from it is to risk being written into it, body and soul.

Scholars still seek it because it holds knowledge found nowhere else: maps of forgotten realms, secrets of lost magics, grim warnings etched by those who did not leave. Yet it is said the Archive does not surrender its treasures easily. The longer one stays, the more the Archive grows attached. Its roots reach into minds, dreams, and memories, seeking to expand its endless garden of knowing. The Verdant Archive does not fall into ruin. It merely waits for new seeds to plant.

## Ashdrinker

Ashdrinker is a living inferno given form, a creature or force that consumes the very essence of anything sentient it burns. Its flames leave behind no smoke, only gray, crumbling dust that sometimes stirs and reshapes into malevolent, sentient monsters. Entire towns have vanished into silent ash fields overnight, with no survivors left to speak of it. Worse still, the fires Ashdrinker spreads are unnatural, growing hotter and more voracious the more life they consume. Blazes left in its wake can burn for weeks, or even years, where the devastation is greatest.

## Blooming Silence

It starts with the quiet, an unnatural hush that rolls through the streets like a thick mist. No footsteps, no birds, no voices. At first, people think it's just another dead zone, another wound left by the Calamities. But then the changes begin. Buildings reshape into old childhood homes. Cobblestone streets turn into gardens long forgotten. Familiar faces appear in the mist, smiling, beckoning, just as they were in better days.

They say the Blooming Silence is at the heart of it, a flower larger than a house, drinking not just sound but memory itself. The more it feeds, the more detailed the false world becomes perfect recreations of the things you loved most, stitched together from stolen minds. People who get too close forget why they ever wanted to leave. Some say it’s mercy. Others say it's the most dangerous trap Atlas has ever grown.

But no one really knows what happens if the flower keeps blooming, and who you might become if you forget enough.

## The Pale Choir

The Pale Choir is a legion of broken, emaciated angels, once radiant beings, now corrupted into hollowed shells that drift across the skies of Atlas. Their bodies are skeletal and rotted, their wings tattered and brittle, yet they still sing with haunting, otherworldly voices. Wherever their music echoes, chaos follows: cities unravel into madness, the ground twists unnaturally, and even the most steadfast minds crack under the strain. The Choir’s song is not meant for mortal ears, it frays reality itself, and those who hear it either fall into delirium or vanish without a trace.
