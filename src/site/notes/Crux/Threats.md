## Threat Rating System

| Name  | Intensity              | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alpha | Significant Threat     | A powerful but manageable disaster or enemy. Causes localized devastation but can be contained or survived with coordinated effort.                             |
| Beta  | Major Crisis           | A widespread threat that overwhelms normal defenses. Entire districts, regions, or populations are at serious risk without immediate, large-scale intervention. |
| Gamma | Existential Emergency  | A critical event that endangers the survival of whole cities, cultures, or ecosystems. Without extraordinary action, collapse or annihilation is likely.        |
| Omega | Extinction-Level Event | A cataclysm from which survival is nearly impossible. Civilization, and possibly life itself, is expected to end unless the impossible occurs.                  |

*This Threat Rating System is used for most, if not all Threats in Atlas and Crux. However, these are mainly applied to the [[Crux/Calamities\|Calamities]] that roam Atlas.*
## Weather Events

In the world of Atlas, weather is more than just a backdrop—it’s a force of nature, magic, and memory. Twisted by centuries of calamity, storms can range from the mundane to the utterly supernatural: freezing rain that whispers, lightning that severs memory, or fog that carries away the living. Even the floating city of [[Crux/Crux\|Crux]] is not immune. Breaches in the city's ancient walls allow these warped weather fronts to spill inside, turning districts into battlegrounds against the skies themselves. Every crack in Crux is a reminder—the world below still hungers, and sometimes, it reaches upward.

## Monsters

Though [[Crux/Crux\|Crux]] floats above the shattered world, it is far from safe. Monsters lurk within its broken districts, with no known reason how. Some hide in the ruins and sewers, others roam the collapsed streets where the shadows are thickest. Without centralized defenses, each district must fend for itself—and the creatures that stalk Crux are as much a threat as starvation or decay. In Crux, survival means watching the shadows as much as anywhere else.

## Corrupted Humanoids

Not all threats in [[Crux/Crux\|Crux]] wear monstrous forms—some walk the streets unseen. There are those who, desperate for power, survival, or immortality, have made fell bargains with things best left unnamed. Corrupted humanoids, their souls tainted and their bodies twisted in subtle or horrific ways, trade the lives of others to extend their lives. They move among the living, feeding quietly off others or carrying out dark agendas. In Crux, the line between desperate survivor and monster is often paper-thin—and sometimes, you don’t see it until it’s far too late.

## Murderers

In [[Waterside/Waterside\|Waterside]], survival may demand sacrifice or hardship, but unjust murder is an unforgivable crime. Those found guilty of killing another without cause are reviled by the community and face the ultimate penalty: death. Justice here is swift and final—no trial lasts long when the blood is fresh. Known murderers are relentlessly hunted, forced into the ruins and shadows where desperation drives them to ever darker acts to avoid capture. In a place already drowning in hardship, murder is seen not just as a crime, but as a betrayal of the highest order.

## Disease

Disease is a constant shadow over Waterside, as common as mold and much more deadly. Cramped living, stagnant water, and the scars of old magic make illness a daily threat. Before the portals reopened, the district’s lone paladin fought a losing battle to contain outbreaks, their healing stretched thinner with each passing season. Even now, remedies, healers, and any means to stave off sickness are treasured more than gold. In Waterside, a cough can be a death sentence—and hope often rides on the thinnest thread.

## Falling

In [[Crux/Crux\|Crux]], one misstep can mean death. Broken walkways and unstable ruins hide fatal drops, and a fall from the city almost always ends in oblivion. Few survive, and fewer are ever found.
