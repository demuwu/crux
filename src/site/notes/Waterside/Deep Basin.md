Now a sunken grave, transformed by collapse, neglect, and the slow seep of arcane corrosion into the swampy hollow it is known by now, choked with decay. The air is humid, heavy with rot but laced with a strange sweetness from blooming toxic lilies and nectar-laced vines.

Locals say the Basin is alive and it listens, things buried beneath it whisper in the night. It’s become a place of desperation and secrecy: smugglers, cults, and the truly hopeless. Few enter it alone, fewer still return clean.

Waterlogged and stagnant, the Basin’s edges are lined with slanted stonework and cracked floodgates. Murky pools gather where channels used to flow, ringed by clusters of fungus, creeping moss, and thorny reeds. 

Mud Islands, patches of dry land, are held together by twisted roots and debris. These islands dot the basin’s floor, creating a patchwork of soggy paths and uncertain footing. Old fishing platforms remain, shattered bridges and half-submerged statues that are a testament to a time where the Basin was beautiful.   

The Basin now teems with strange life, mutated fish with translucent eyes, invasive plants that pulse with light, and insect swarms that glitter with unnatural hues. Creatures have also moved in, amphibious scavengers, creeping horrors, and twisted things born from runoff and arcane drift. The air buzzes with life, but not the kind people can trust.
