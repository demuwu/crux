Built into a partially collapsed aqueduct, The Slovenly Slop is Waterside’s most infamous watering hole. The desperate, the damned, and the dehydrated go to forget, plot, or bleed quietly into a bowl of something vaguely edible. 

The air reeks of stale ale, wet moss, and fermented failure. Floors are sticky, stools are uneven, and the ceiling drips with something that might be condensation. Lit by flickering lanterns and old lamps buzzing with barely-contained magic, the bar is cloaked in a perpetual half-shadow, perfect for whispered deals and stolen glances. Every now and again there may be a brave soul to play music for the people that attend that evening.

The bar itself is a long, stained plank of reclaimed shipwood, scorched and scratched from decades of abuse. A massive iron pot bubbles in the corner, what’s in it is called The Slop. No one knows the recipe. Some say it changes if you stare into it too long.

Some notable features include a wall covered in knives, peoples’ names scratched into it, some still warm. There’s a trapdoor behind the bar that may lead to the cellar, or that’s what the barkeep says. Others say it leads to a fight pit… Or worse, a second bar. 

A chalkboard near the entrance that may list daily drinks, or random quotes, maybe a request for help from a civilian or two.
