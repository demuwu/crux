Cramped and unwelcoming. The entryway is a narrow metal-reinforced door that opens into a short hallway that carries hooks for cloaks, racks for weapons or tools, and a storage bin built into the wall. The floor is concrete or rusted metal, often patched with cloth or wooden planks. 

The common area is a small, multi-use living space with a table, four mismatched stools, and a compact kitchenette (sink, salvaged stove or hotplate). Cabinets are made from repurposed crates. 

The sleeping area is divided by patchwork curtains or thin salvaged wall panels. The bunk area includes two double-bunked cots with thin mattresses, netting for personal storage and very little privacy. 

The bathroom is cramped with a tiny wash basin, a single toilet, and a narrow shower stall. Water is either drawn from the main line or stored in tanks filled via buckets or siphons. Drainage is connected to the ancient sewer system which is often requiring regular maintenance by the tenants themselves.
