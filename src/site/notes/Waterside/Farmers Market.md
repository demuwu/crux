Nestled in a half-collapsed plaza, the Wasterside Farmersâ€™ Market despite the ruin, the rot, and the risk of mutated bugs, people still gather here to trade the edible, the medicinal, and perhaps the strange. 

Stalls are shoddily built, made from driftwood and canvas, others out of the old wagon wheels and sewer grates. Most lean at odd angles, but all are alive with colour and chaos. Crowds buzz with barter and banter. Musicians are often paid in scraps and play tunes to add rhythm to the rattle of trade.
