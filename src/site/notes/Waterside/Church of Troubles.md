The Church of Troubles stands as a crooked relic of forgotten faith. Its bells long silenced by rust and sorrow. Yet within its walls, the desperate still gather, whether drawn by salvation or shared suffering.

The Church of Troubles offers no false promises, only recognition. Pain is not hidden, wounds are not healed. They are named, witnessed, and shared. Here, one lonely priest often visits the Church of Troubles, spending their days tidying up the church to their best abilities, and hearing people out whenever visited. It’s not much, but it’s honest work.
