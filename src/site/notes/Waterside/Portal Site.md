Far below the flooded, wet streets the Subterranean Portal Site lies buried in the city’s forgotten veins. Once a crypt or sanctum from an older world, this chamber is now a sealed convergence point where reality folds and something else tries to bleed through.

This site is accessed through a rusted freight elevator, making the path to it dangerous and claustrophobic. The deeper one goes, the air thickens with damp and dread and the walls hum with unnatural vibrations. 

The chamber itself is a massive stone vault, reinforced with whatever salvaged steel that was found. The portal resembles a vertical mirror of still, liquid light that is suspended within an ancient ritual circle with runes scorched into the floor, pulsing faintly. Heavily fortified barricades and rotating guard posts surround the chamber’s outer ring making it nearly impossible for people to sneak in or for things to sneak out, hopefully.
