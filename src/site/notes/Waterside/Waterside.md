The Waterside District currently clings to survival amidst ruin. Ravaged by collapse and neglect, the shimmering lake of the [[Waterside/Deep Basin\|Deep Basin]] has receded into a swampy hollow, and the once-pristine canals are now choked with debris and overgrowth. Everything still endures, but just barely.

The citizens remaining have come together to create dilapidated, cramped apartments for those who still need a place to sleep. Along the apartments, ramshackled guild halls have also been erected to serve as a meeting grounds for minor factions to nurture survivability and hope. 

The Farmers Market is a tangle of tarp-covered stalls and barter tables. Beneath it all, the sewers run deep, ancient and partially unexplored, now a shadowy network of tunnels to house smuggling routes, feral creatures, and maybe something far older. Above it all, a crumbling church rises defiantly, where people may come to pray and contemplate.Â 
  
At the edge of it all sits something new and heavily fortified: a portal site, guarded by a trusted knight which is looked towards as a new hope.**
