## [[Guilds/Guilds\|Guilds]]

In [[Waterside/Waterside\|Waterside]], guilds are the lifeblood of survival and structure, fractured communities bound together by trade, ideology, or necessity. With the district cut off and resources scarce, guilds serve as everything from defense forces and crafting collectives to black market brokers and political factions. Whether built from shared skills or sheer desperation, each guild carves out its own corner of influence, offering protection, purpose, and identity in a city where law is fading and unity is earned.

## Criminals

In Waterside, criminals are as much a part of the ecosystem as they are the rot. With fractured authority stretched thin, smugglers, thieves, and fixers thrive in the shadows, moving goods, secrets, and people where official channels no longer reach. Some are parasites, others are necessary evils, and a few are folk heroes in the eyes of the desperate. In a district surviving on scraps, crime isn’t just rebellion, it’s often the only thing they think that works.

## Leadership

The [[Politics/Redmarch Council\|Redmarch Council]] serves as Waterside’s ruling body, not by decree, but by necessity. Formed from survivors too stubborn or skilled to let the district collapse entirely, the council is a balance of discipline, compassion, and unflinching pragmatism. Each member holds sway over a pillar of survival: infrastructure, spirit, and security. Though far from unified in philosophy, they are bound by a shared truth, if they falter, Waterside dies with them. In a district built on rust, rot, and ritual, the Redmarch Council is the closest thing left to order.

The [[Politics/Highborn\|Highborn]] are a loose coalition of ancient families and influential individuals, each able to trace their lineage back through generations of power, prestige, or divine right. Though they stand at the pinnacle of wealth and influence within Crux, their unity is fragile at best, fractured by rivalries, pride, and centuries of political entanglements. Rarely do they act in concert, and only threats that endanger their collective status or survival can compel them to set aside personal ambition for a shared cause.
