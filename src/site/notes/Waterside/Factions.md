[[Guilds/Guilds\|Guilds]]

In [[Waterside/Waterside\|Waterside]], guilds are the lifeblood of survival and structureâ€”fractured communities bound together by trade, ideology, or necessity. With the district cut off and resources scarce, guilds serve as everything from defense forces and crafting collectives to black market brokers and political factions. Whether built from shared skills or sheer desperation, each guild carves out its own corner of influence, offering protection, purpose, and identity in a city where law is fading and unity is earned.
