A vast, decaying labyrinth that is older than any living soul in Crux. Built during the city’s golden age to channel clean water and waste alike, they now serve a different purpose. It smells of damp rust, oil, and wet stone.

The layout of the sewers is multi-tiered and partially collapsed. It ranges from cramped crawlspaces to massive, vaulted drainage halls. Some are dry, some are flooded ankle-deep (or deeper) with brackish, glowing runoff. Crumbling bridges span pits where filtration chambers once churned, and rusted walkways cling to moss-slick walls. Echoes carry far, making it hard to know what’s real and coming.

The sewers are known for its hidden entrances, disguised access points that may be found behind guildhalls, under the church, or hidden among debris. Old tech, strange machines that still hum in the dark, their purposes forgotten. They’re either power filtration units or something less comprehensible. Portal leakages, arcane energy that creeps through parts of the sewer if a portal is in close proximity; rumors say it warps the tunnels itself.
