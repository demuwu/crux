##### Hearts Giving Day - Spring

When the first blooms of spring appear in Waterside’s cracks and crumbled gardens, the people celebrate Hearts Giving Day. It’s a time to offer small, hand-grown gifts from flowers to simple sketches of loved ones; from friends to family, even strangers. 
##### The Pale Discordia -Winter

During the harshest nights of winter, Waterside fills with wild, clashing music for The Pale Discordia. Makeshift instruments; scrap drums, cracked flutes, bent strings. Citizens play raucous, off-key songs in the streets. Though the tunes are chaotic, laughter rises with them; it is a defiant celebration of survival, a noisy promise that even in the dead of winter, Waterside’s spirit will not fall silent.
##### Spooksday - Autumn

A very mischievous holiday, Spooksday sees Waterside children and adults alike donning costumes and roaming the market ruins. They play tricks, barter for sweets, and tell tales of monsters that crawl from the Deep Basin. At least, for one night, Spooksday lets the fears be a game.
##### The Heat Harvest - Summer

When the hot summer sun scorches the swampy corners of Waterside, the people hold the Heat Harvest. The festival is where crops are gathered quickly before they spoil and fish are dried or salted. Songs are sung to honor laborers, and the market brims with hard-earned abundance before the heat wilts the world once more.
##### Champions Day - Summer

Champions Day honors those few who defend Waterside’s battered streets and crumbling sewers. Tournaments of strength, wit, and endurance are held in makeshift arenas, and the winners are crowned with laurels of riverweed and copper. It is a day when the battered folk remember they can still fight and win.
##### The Day of Hope - Winter

On the shortest, darkest day of winter, Waterside lights candles in every window and doorway for The Day of Hope. It is a quiet, heartfelt ritual, meant to defy despair. Families gather close, share warm broth and bread, and whisper promises to endure until the world thaws again.
##### Verdant Revel - Spring 

Verdant Revel bursts into Waterside with an explosion of color. Citizens dress in flowing, flower-themed costumes, their clothes decked with fresh blooms or painted in leafy patterns. Parades of green and gold wind through the cramped streets, a living prayer that new life will reclaim even the deepest cracks of the ruined district.
##### Emberdance - Summer

Bonfires roar in the courtyards and  hollowed-out plazas of Waterside. People dance in the stone streets, weaving between flames with wild, joyous abandon. The fires are said to burn away ill luck, sickness, and sorrow but only if you dance without fear.
##### Day of Remembrance - Autumn

As leaves turn to fall, Waterside gatherers for the Day of Remembrance. Names of the dead are carved into ribbons of cloth and tied to withered trees or sunken bridges. Some say the spirits of the lost walk among the living that night, warmed by the memories of those who still care.
##### The Binding of Shadows - Autumn

During the Binding of Shadows, fear of the unseen spirits run high. Citizens scatter salt across their thresholds and rub it into their skin, a symbolic act meant to “bind” their shadows and keep them from being stolen by darker forces. Lanterns, heavy and flickering, are hung from every post and door offering light in a season when the dark grows thick and hungry.
