##### Invasions

In Waterside, invasions are a grim fear that our last hope of the portals are turned against us. Breaches in Crux’s battered hull, or desperate monsters from within the city itself serve as reminders to this fragility.
##### Leadership Shifts

Leadership, and by extension the political climate of Waterside is never set in stone. Different factions vie for influence and power, wishing to push forward their own visions for the future. Various guild leaders, faction leaders or political groups might shift and change over the course of time due to the actions of players, other groups or events.
##### Strange Markets

Occasionally, mysterious shopkeepers will be found during sessions, or arrive at Waterside to ply their trade. Such trade is highly sought, and can bring many wanted (or unwanted) commodities to the people. Typically, the more expensive items are sold at the market where interested parties can bid for them. But not all traders are benevolent, and most are watched with a keen eye and concern.  

Such biddings can sometimes have alternative prices, or strange offers needed to attempt the purchase.
##### Conflicts

In rare but unfortunate circumstances, some groups may face irreconcilable differences that escalate into conflict or worse, full-scale war. Such events are dangerous and deeply damaging to the fragile stability of Waterside, and are avoided whenever possible. Most disputes are settled through sanctioned bloodsports, where champions fight in predetermined arenas, or through public debates of ideals. In more secretive cases, tensions simmer into hidden "shadow wars," where influence, sabotage, and silent strikes decide the victor without open battle.
##### Diplomatic Meetings

When it comes to outsiders, Waterside holds a simple belief: more resources are always valuable. Beneficial trade agreements are highly encouraged, strengthening the district’s ability to survive and grow. Occasionally, outside groups will approach Waterside seeking to establish such relationships, offering goods, knowledge, or alliances in exchange for cooperation.
##### Calamities

The monstrous calamities are a constant fear for those living on Atlas and within Crux. They pose a grave threat to all life, their presence a reminder of how fragile survival truly is. Worse still, it is believed that even more calamities exist hidden, waiting, and unknown.
##### Magic

We know it, you know it, magic gets weird. It's just as likely to save your life as it is to set your boots on fire. Every now and then, something strange and supernatural happens, and honestly, we usually don’t figure out what it was until it’s already too late.
##### Mystery

Waterside is thick with mysteries. Strange lights flicker beneath the surface of the flooded basin; entire blocks seem to vanish in heavy fog, only to reappear days later, subtly changed. Some claim there are hidden vaults sealed beneath the district, remnants of Crux’s first desperate days, while others speak of ghost-markets that trade only in dreams and memories. The old church bells sometimes ring by themselves and it’s said that in the deepest reaches of the broken sewer tunnels, something ancient still stirs. In Waterside, every shadow hides a rumor, every ruin holds a secret, and the greatest dangers are not always the ones you can see.
##### Crime

Crime is as common as the mist that rolls off the broken streets. Petty theft, smuggling, and black-market dealings thrive in the cramped markets and crumbling guildhalls. Smuggling is rampant, goods, relics, and even forbidden magics pass unseen through sewer tunnels and hidden portals. A merchant who refuses to pay may find their stall burned or their wares “mysteriously” ruined. Kidnapping, extortion, and quiet assassinations occur in the shadows, though it would be best to not be caught with the latter crime. Killing means death penalty.
