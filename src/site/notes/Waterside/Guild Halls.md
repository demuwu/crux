Built from scavenged metal, broken stone and lumber. Despite their ramshackle appearances, each hall is the heart of a faction, trade, or ideology. They’re gathering spots, training spaces, deal tables, and homes to secrets no outsider hears twice. 

A typical guildhall size may vary, but usually has 3 rooms at Guild Rank 1. 

The common hall is the front room, large and open space. Lit by hanging lanterns or crystals. It functions as a meeting chamber, drinking area, or tactical table. 

The workshop or craft area is a side room filled with tools, half-assembled gear, or magic implements depending on the guild’s trade.

The back office or vault room is an always locked room where the guildmaster keeps contracts, ledgers, and the guild’s loot.
