Portals are mysterious rifts in space and time, remnants of the old world’s once-thriving magical infrastructure. They are windows to forgotten places and other planes of existence. Their true nature remains largely unknown with each portal behaving differently, with some leading to far-off lands, others opening onto dreamlike realms where time doesn’t flow normally, and a few opening directly to dangerous and chaotic planes filled with monstrosities. 

These rifts could also be more than just a means of travel. They might hold the keys to the forgotten knowledge, power, allies, and resources that can in turn be used to help Crux survive and nurture hope for the future.  

Given the dangerous nature of portals, fortification has become an absolute necessity. Many portals are heavily guarded, with defenses and guard posts surrounding them. With the growing number of portals being discovered and the fear of otherworldly threats, a single Paladin ensures that foreign afflictions, whether they are diseases, curses, or other forms of contamination does not spread.
