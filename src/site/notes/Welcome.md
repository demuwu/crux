# **The Fractured World of Atlas**

Over five centuries have passed since the surface of Atlas was last truly seen—obscured by ruin. A chain of world-breaking calamities shattered the great civilizations, reshaped the lands, and unleashed horrors that still roam the broken continent. Entire kingdoms crumbled in hours, swallowed by the darkness.

High above the ravaged earth drifts [[Crux/Crux\|Crux]], the last sanctuary of what was once called civilization. Suspended by ancient magics and unknown machinery, this floating city shelters the remnants of Atlas’ past. Within its walls, a fragile order is preserved.

In the distant past, the ancestors of Crux lowered their city and opened their gates to thousands fleeing the dying world, using vital power and resources to lift refugees into safety. Their mercy came at great cost—Crux was battered, its foundations strained, and much of its knowledge and power lost in the effort. The city survived, but it has never fully healed.

In the centuries since, survivors adapted in isolation. These migrants endured in harsh new environments, evolving into diverse societies shaped more by necessity than tradition. Many cling to ancient beliefs, others have forged entirely new ways of life amid the chaos. Though scattered, these groups share one truth: the world below is no longer theirs.

Yet even now from the heights of Crux, the scars of Atlas remain visible. Monstrosities prowl the blighted lands. Calamities still roam across the horizon. And the world below hungers for you.
