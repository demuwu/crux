Starting Level: 1

There are three (3) ways of generating Player Characters (PCs):

- Point buy with 30 points.

- Roll for stats, taking standard array if you roll below a 72 total and you don't wish to take it.
	- &{template:default} {{name= Ability Scores}} {{[[4d6kh3\|4d6kh3]][[4d6kh3\|4d6kh3]][[4d6kh3\|4d6kh3]][[4d6kh3\|4d6kh3]][[4d6kh3\|4d6kh3]][[4d6kh3\|4d6kh3]]}}
	- Standard array: (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8)

- Roll for each stat individually, taking the result rolled for the score. Eg, roll for Strength, then roll for Dexterity etc. If you get a score below 72 or no stat at 14 or higher, you can reroll.
	- &{template:default} {{name= Rolling Stats for ?{Character name}}} {{Str [[4d6d1\|4d6d1]]}}  {{Dex [[4d6d1\|4d6d1]]}} {{Con [[4d6d1\|4d6d1]]}} {{Int [[4d6d1\|4d6d1]]}} {{Wis [[4d6d1\|4d6d1]]}} {{Cha [[4d6d1\|4d6d1]]}}

**REQUEST A LINK TO THE ROLL20 GAME FROM ONE OF THE DM’s Via PM!**

A character sheet will be automatically generated for you by Roll20. It should appear at the bottom of your journal as "YourRoll20Name's Character". If you don't see this, rejoin the game. If you still do not see it, PM one of the DMs to get it sorted.

**Character Creation Notes**:
- All rolls must be made in the Roll20 Chat interface so that they are logged. You must indicate what you are rolling before you roll it.
- If you don't have a name, just put "(Player name)'s new character" with your name between the [ ]s.


1. A list of available sources for all characters, are listed below. 
	- [5.5ke Dungeons and Dragons](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/J8s2RJZln2l9)
2. All alignments allowed, but anti-party behaviour in a session is not.
3. Find a good, non-offensive picture for your character and make it into a token using [https://rolladvantage.com/tokenstamp/](https://rolladvantage.com/tokenstamp/) or any other sources you may have available.
4. Character Names may not contain anything offensive. DMs reserve the right to request you change a character's name.
5. You cannot play a character that is underage for the race, you may only play adults. For example, Elves reach adulthood at the age of 100, so you cannot play elves that are younger than 100 years.
6. Take time to get familiar with the Roll20 character sheet interface. Fill out your spells and abilities as completely as you can to avoid slowing the game down during play. Please note that you can drag spells and items from the compendium, so you don’t have to set up every individual macro.
7. You MUST have the following settings on your Roll20 Sheet. This can be edited via the cogwheel on your Roll20 sheet in the top-right corner, underneath the box that has your Character Name, Level, Class, etc:
	- ROLL QUERIES: Advantage Toggle
	- WHISPER ROLLS TO GM: Whisper Toggle
	- AUTO DAMAGE ROLL: Auto Roll Damage & Crit
	- Check ON ADD DEX TIEBREAKER TO INITIATIVE**
